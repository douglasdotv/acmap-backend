# Acmap Backend

This is the backend of the Acmap project, developed using Java with Spring Boot. It's designed to process and provide air crash data for the [frontend](https://github.com/douglasdotv/acmap-frontend). The back end handles data storage, processing, and serves as a REST API to feed the interactive air crash map on the frontend. Includes integration with a PostgreSQL database.
